Project Overview
This project connects a user-submitted loan application form to a real-time dashboard in the Loan Manager system. Built with Node.js and SQLite3, the backend handles form submissions, data validation, and statistics generation. The React.js frontend fetches and displays this data dynamically, following the provided Figma design to ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience.

Live Demo
Tech Stack
I used React.js for building the frontend interface, Node.js for backend logic, and SQLite3 as the database to store user input securely and efficiently.

Features & Requirements
Form Integration
I used React for building the frontend interface and SQLite3 for data storage. Upon submission, loan application data is securely stored in the SQLite3 database.

Dashboard Functionality
The dashboard is designed to display real-time data reflecting key statistics from submitted loan applications. It automatically updates as new forms are submitted, providing both users and administrators with instant insights into application trends and status. This dynamic updating ensures that the dashboard remains accurate and relevant, facilitating informed decision-making at all times.
